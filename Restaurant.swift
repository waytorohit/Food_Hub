// initialization is the process of prepairing an instance of a class. An instance is a concrete occurance of any object, 


/*In	Swift,	you	use	self	to	differentiate	between	property	names	and	arguments	in
initializers.	Because	the	arguments	have	the	same	name	as	the	properties,	we
use	self	to	refer	to	the	property	of	the	class.*/
